New features:

3.09:

 - New, portable Process implementation (experimental)

 - Simplified Makefiles (needs further simplification)

3.08:

 - Incompatible change:
   Public member Facility::in protected and replaced by method In()
   Solution: replace  fac.in => fac.In()

 - Incompatible change:
   Return type of SimObject::Name() changed to std::string
   Solution: add .c_str() if used in Print/printf (e.g. obj.Name().c_str())

 - using some C++11 features (we need newer compiler)

 - cppcheck warnings mostly eliminated

 - bugfixes
